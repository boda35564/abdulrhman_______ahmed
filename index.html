                    <h3>project1</h3>
                    <p>The research problem is to seek a solution to the problem of wasting water using traditional methods in irrigating agricultural land, which was subject to human error in terms of wasting water, in addition to saving time and effort, and saving labor. In light of President Sisi's pursuit of the problem of wasting water, after feeling the problem, it was identified and hypotheses were imposed that led to the solution, and those hypotheses were tested through experimentation, through which solutions to the problem were reached at the beginning, as we searched for the problem and its impact on individuals and society, and we collected some different solutions and chose the most effective, easiest to implement and cheapest.

                        • An experiment was conducted on a farm with an area of ​​​​10 acres and using old and modern smart irrigation
                        
                        • The project consists of four plastic greenhouses in addition to an irrigation tank.
                        • The basic idea is to control more than one greenhouse or agricultural plot through the Internet using a mobile phone from anywhere in the world
                        
                        Choose the serial number or plot of land from a mobile phone and enter the irrigation start time and stop time
                        
                        • Irrigation is done through an irrigation tank that contains a sensor that gives
                        
                        A warning that the water level inside is less than a certain level, and the water
                        
                        is distributed using water pumps.
                        • The project includes a solar cell system to charge the battery
                        
                        • Design uses RemoteXY Plateform
                        • The application can control the project via
                        "How the project was chosen"
                        • Whereas in light of President Sisi's pursuit and the problem of water waste, as after feeling the problem, it was identified and assumptions were imposed that lead to the solution
                        • When experimenting with a 10-acre farm, it needs 10,000 cubic meters annually in irrigation by flooding, while using modern irrigation with a smart remote irrigation control device, it was reduced to 1,000 cubic meters annually
                        
                        "Statistics"
                        • Egypt's water resources are estimated at about 60 billion cubic meters annually of water, most of which comes from the Nile River in addition to quantities of rainwater and deep groundwater in the deserts. In contrast, the total water needs in Egypt reach about 114 billion cubic meters annually in water
                        
                        "Materials used"
                        "Main parts of the project"
                        • Communication protocol
                        • Android application
                        • Solar cell system
                        • Printed circuit board
